A co-worker of mine, feoMike (aka Mike Byrne) who is the FCC's Chief GIS guy, asked me for a little help with his personal site.

He wanted to run off of Github using gh-pages. I forked Mike's repo, [feo.github.com](http://github.com/feomike/feomike.github.com), and started working. Since I had Jekyll [installed locally](/posts/re-thinking-the-way-i-build-websites.html), I was up and running pretty quickly. This saves me from have to push to see changes ... over and over and over. I simply run the build locally, make sure it checks out ok, push to my repo and send the pull request to Mike.

[Check it out](http://feomike.github.io). And yes, I do realize it's a lot like this site. More to come though.
