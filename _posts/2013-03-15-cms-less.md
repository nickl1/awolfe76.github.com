title: Re-thinking the way I build websites ... simplifying
desc: So now I simply setup the Jekyll structure for any site and have it build as I commit. At that point I can either use Github as the host and commit content and template changes or grab the html from the _site folder and give it to a client or push it via FTP or whatever. <strong>SIMPLE.</strong>

#### Update

<p class="date">April 20, 2013</p>

I recently released the [DaVinci's Pizzeria](http://davincispizzeria.com/) site using the process described below. It's [hosted](https://github.com/awolfe76/davincis/tree/gh-pages) on Github using gh-pages.

I won't bore you with the "cms-less" movement. There has been plenty written about this approach over the past several months already. Google it.

### Proof

But I will say that I have bought into the idea. I have already used this approach with 2 websites built for my employer, the FCC; the [LEARN Program](http://wireless.fcc.gov/incentiveauctions/learn-program) and [Signal Boosters](http://wireless.fcc.gov/signal-boosters). I have also moved 2 sites that I built a while back to Github, as projects, and used Jekyll to re-build them; [Wolfe Proposals](http://wolfeproposals.com) and [John Wolfe Dental](http://wolfefamilydental.com). And now I'm using this site as my personal site.

### Building - how to (and how not to)

For a while I just let Github's gh-pages build process handle the builds but came to realize that this wouldn't work. It's nearly impossible to debug issues that way. So I had to get Jekyll installed and configured locally. This is pretty straight forward, a huge thanks to [Andy Taylor](http://andytaylor.me/) for his post on "[Installing Ruby & Jekyll on Mac OS X](http://andytaylor.me/2012/11/03/installing-ruby-and-jekyll/)". Following that will get you there.

So now I simply setup the Jekyll structure for any site and have it build. At that point I can either use Github as the host and commit content and template changes or grab the html from the _site folder and give it to a client or push it via FTP or whatever. __SIMPLE.__
