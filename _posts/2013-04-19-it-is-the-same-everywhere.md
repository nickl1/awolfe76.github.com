title: It Really is the Same Everywhere
desc: I recently bought a pop-up camper so my family (wife, 2 daughters, and dog) and I can begin to enjoy camping again. A couple of mishaps happened during the process and in conversations with the salesman I realized that we all go through the <strong>SAME THINGS</strong>.

During a recent purchase of a new pop-up camper we can across a few mishaps.

- the igniter for the gas was busted (technical term)
- the lock didn't work (turned out to be the wrong key)
- the extension cord to charge the battery was missing

### Just get the job done

The last issue is what started the conversation. Because of the other issues the salesman was going to __give__ me the extension cord and he used the lines "I just want to get it done now. You've been through enough with this already and if I go 'by the book' it will take forever to get you something you need and should have had in the first place."

WOW! I say that on an almost daily basis. At least the "I just want to get it done" part. So many times there is so much red-tape in the way that something that should take an hour, or even a few seconds, takes days or weeks instead. As in this case, he grabbed the cord from another pop-up and handed it to me. Had he gone "by the book" the cord would have had to have been shipped to me or I would have had to return to pick it up.

I loved his attitude and appreciated it. <em>And often use it in my own job.</em> But it was really interested that even in camper sales there is just too much red-tape.
