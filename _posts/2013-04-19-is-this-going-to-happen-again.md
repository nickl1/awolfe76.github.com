title: Is this going to happen again in a few years?
desc: Is this going to happen again? I don't know for sure, but I do know that technology changes daily, so the odds that we'll have to re-do something in a few years are good. So, actually, my answer is a simple <strong>YES</strong>.

In a recent conversation regarding a redesign of a website to use a responsive design the question was asked of me, "Is this going to happen again in a couple years or is responsive design here to stay?" While I understood where the person was coming from, management thinks about time and money (and they should), there was no way I could answer that question. What I do know is that the web is in the very early stages of idea of responsive design, but that it also works right now. And that I absolutely think it is the correct approach ... for now.

Responsive design allows us to account for any screen size (NOT DEVICES), it allows us to build once for all of them. It also makes us consider or even re-consider our content, what's important and what isn't, what should be the focus, what do we need, what don't we need.

It's a great way to think about and build websites, and for the next few years will probably get even better. So let's do it and if something better comes along in a few years, well, we'll worry about that then. But __YES__, we will probably be doing this again.
