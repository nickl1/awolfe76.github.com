title: I Am a Web Designer / Developer, But Read the Job Description
desc: I’ve been a web designer / developer for almost 15 years. Wow, that's a long time to have a single job title. But technology changes so much, even within a small corner of it, that the job title (or, at the very least, the description of it) changes too. <strong>SO READ THE JOB DESCRIPTION, NOT JUST THE TITLE.</strong>

I’ve been a web designer / developer for almost 15 years. Wow, that's a long time to have a single job title. But technology changes so much, even within a small corner of it, that the job title (or, at the very least, the description of it) changes too.

### Job title, no, job description

At the beginning, 15 years ago, the job description would have probably included:

- HTML
- Maybe that's it???

Then:

- HTML
- CSS
- Table-less web design

Then:

- HTML
- CSS (tables are gone, except for table data)
- Javascript
- AJAX

Now:

- HTML (5)
- CSS (3)
- Responsive design
- Grid layouts
- Javascript, both client and server-side (AJAX is just included)
- Knowledge of CMS frameworks (like Drupal or WordPress or one of the other 100's out there)
- Server side programming (like PHP, Ruby, Java, .NET or one of the other 1000's out there)
- Version control (like Git/Github, CVS, SVN or one of the other 100's out there)
- Server OS installation and maintenance (*nix)
- Database installation and maintenance (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle)
- Content Strategist
- Information Architect
- Usability Testing
- Performance Testing
- Knowledge of 508

This list could go on and on.

### The point is change

The point is that my job changes and I have to learn more on an almost daily basis. It's not just wash, rinse, and repeat anymore. I started with HTML, learned CSS, learned javascript, learned PHP, learned a few CMS tools.

I am learning Ruby. I am learning responsive design. I am learning CSS3. I am re-learning javascript. I am learning HTML5. I am learning Apache. I am learning Git/Github. I am learning Linux. I am learning content (the many aspects of it). I am becoming a command-line junky (I used to stomp my feet at it and demand a UI).

I'm definitely not claiming to be an expert in all or any of these. But I have definitely dabbled in all of it over the past few years.

<strong>I have to. I have to keep up.</strong> I've also realized that I'm getting older and it won't be long until some young whipper-snapper can take my place.

Ok, now I have a headache and have realized I have to get back to work because I have a lot of web designing, developing, installing (uninstalling), testing, content migrating, usability testing, performance testing, database configuring, information architecting, command-lining to do.

### I'll keep it because I like it

So I'll keep my job title, please just realize that calling me a web designer / developer means a lot more these days.

<strong>** NOTE:</strong> None of this is a complaint. I love what I do. I am lucky that way.

I have had this post on the back burner of some time. Inspired to get it done by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and his [The Designer-Developer spectrum](http://markdotto.com/2013/04/22/designer-developer-spectrum/) post.
